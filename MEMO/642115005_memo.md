## problem
1.unreadable data problems
2.Recreating the data storage problem
3.Resolving SCSI device problems
4.Checking the server activity log to resolve data storage issues
5.Checking HELP for messages issued for a data storage problem
6.Resolving data storage errors related to reading or writing to a device
7.Changing the storage hierarchy to resolve data storage problems
8.Changing the server policies to resolve data storage problems
9.Resolving a data storage backup or copy problem that occurs only with a specific node
10.Resolving a data storage problem that occurs only for a specific volume
11.Hints and tips for storage
12.Resolving sequential media volume (tape) errors through messages ANR0542W or ANR8778W


### solution for problem 1. You might receive unreadable data during import or node replication processes related to a lack of code page conversion during these processes.
### solution for problem 2. If a problem can be easily or consistently recreated, it might be possible to isolate the cause of the problem to a specific sequence of events.
### solution for problem 3. Tape drives and libraries might report information back to IBM Spectrum Protect about the error encountered. This information is reported in one or more of the messages.

## Decision Driver
If a problem can be easily or consistently recreated, it might be possible to isolate the cause of the problem to a specific sequence of events.
